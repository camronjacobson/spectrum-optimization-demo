## 🎯 Project Overview

During my internship at DLA Piper, I developed this spectrum optimization tool to explore how advanced algorithms can improve wireless network planning. This project demonstrates the intersection of technology, data analysis, and telecommunications infrastructure.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully optimized frequency allocation for 354 wireless stations across the United States, achieving up to **85% spectrum efficiency** through intelligent frequency reuse and geographic analysis.

## 🌐 Background & Motivation

### The Challenge
Radio spectrum is a finite resource worth billions of dollars. As wireless demand grows exponentially with 5G and IoT devices, efficient spectrum management becomes increasingly critical. Poor frequency planning leads to:
- 📵 Interference between services (dropped calls, slow data)
- 💰 Wasted spectrum resources
- 🚫 Limited network capacity
- 📈 Higher costs for consumers and businesses

### The Opportunity
By applying optimization algorithms and geographic intelligence, we can:
- ✅ Dramatically improve spectrum efficiency
- ✅ Enable more services in the same spectrum
- ✅ Reduce interference between stations
- ✅ Support data-driven decision making

## 🗺️ Geographic Analysis Using BEA Regions

### Understanding Business Economic Areas (BEAs)
BEAs are 173 geographic regions defined by the U.S. Department of Commerce. They're particularly relevant for telecommunications because:
- The FCC uses them for spectrum licensing
- They reflect natural economic and commuting patterns
- They provide consistent geographic units for analysis
